## How does it work?

1. Each command variation (boy/girl, cat/not) calls the same function but with a different subreddit
2. Using the reddit JSON API, it receives some info on the top 100 posts of all time
3. Picks a random post. The subreddits are picked to only upload pictures, so it is 99% guaranteed to get a picture output
  - If a person posted multiple images in 1 post, a random image is picked
  - There are 10 backup attempts in case an image is NSFW filtered
4. Send (or don't) the image URL
